I received a message from the user <a href="https://github.com/kuno">kuno</a> on Github today:

<quote>Hi:
My name is kuno, the maintainer of geoip module on nodejs.
Your project GeoIP-js inspired my re-write my module from sketch, appreciate that.
Do you mind I added your name into the contributor list?
If so, may I have your email address?

After looking over his <a href="https://github.com/kuno/GeoIP">geoip module</a>, his project looks to be more in-depth and versatile compared to my rather limited module, which I wrote about <a href="http://joevennix.com/2011/04/25/GeoIP.JS---An-IP-Geolocation-Node-Library.html">here</a>. So, hats off to kuno, I've updated my repo to redirect users to his project. To install kuno's geoip, simply use <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a>:

<pre><code>npm install geoip</code></pre>
